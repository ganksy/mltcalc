The MLT Calculator takes the outputs from a Metallic Line Test on a twisted pair copper broadband network and tells you if the results of the test are in specification. 

The MLT Calculator checks:

- The insulation resistance of each wire to ground

- The capacitance balance of the wires

- The insulation resistance between the wires

This information can help you to determine whether a truck roll is required.
